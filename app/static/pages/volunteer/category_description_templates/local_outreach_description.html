  Although the Oppia Foundation does a lot of work remotely to reach students
  around the world, we need passionate volunteers to help us make Oppia an even
  better resource for the most underserved learners in their own communities!
  Local Outreach volunteers host seminars, talk to schools, reach out to
  parents, and more in order to raise awareness about Oppia to local students
  and families. These volunteers also play a key role in telling us how we can
  make Oppia an even better resource for the students they work with.

  local neighborhood, sign up to be a Local Outreach volunteer today!
